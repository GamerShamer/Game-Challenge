Game-Challenge
==============

Our game features a human character, that we will create, that must avoid falling objects. If the character fails to
avoid an object, it loses a life. The goal of the game is to reach the end of the level without losing all its lives.
The character will progress through levels that will increase in difficulty by changing the quantity of falling objects,
changing the speed at which they descend, and adding obstacles to be avoided. There will also be ways for the character
to gain points and power-ups throughout the levels, such as extra-lives and increased speed. The playerâ€™s score will be
determined by the number of levels completed before all lives are lost.  
The context for the game is a miner avoiding falling grey rocks in a cave, which will be an image background. The
background will be a scrolling background to allow the level to be longer than the length of the screen. The power-ups
will be represented by multicolored diamonds. 
The target audience for this game is elementary school-aged children because it will provide an appropriate level of
difficulty. This game was inspired by a combination of games that the team members played as children.
